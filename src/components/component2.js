            <p>I am passionate about handling raw data and extracting valuable information from this data which can visualized and can be used for building machine learning models. For last few years, there is a huge growth in the rate at which data is being generated and every industry is analysing this data for making their policies and business models which leads to the growth of jobs in this field.</p>
